## Overview

In this project, we created a simple Frontend UI that allows a user to subscribe to a newsletter. This project involves form validation that checks to see if the email is valid, or if the input field is NOT left blank. 

If the email is valid upon submission, the webpage is then rendered with new content on the page, displaying that they have successfully subscribed using their email. 

## The challenge

### User Story

```
AS a user
I WANT to subscribe to a newsletter using my email address
SO THAT I can receive newsletters to my email
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a pretty user interface
WHEN I input my email and click on the button
THEN I am presented with new content on the page that displays that I successfully subscribed
```

### Useful resources

- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19572044/changing-html-content-order-depending-on-screen-size) - This helped me change the HTML content order based on the pixel size of the user's device.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
